# CVPython
This project stores the code involving in the Deep Learning for Computer Vision for Python book.

- The file neuralnetwork.py store the class NeuralNetwork, the design below solve XOR problem.
- The file MNIST.py is a simple introduction to Neural Network with keras.
- The file XOR_keras.py is a simple implementation of XOR dataset by Keras library.
- The file convolutions.py is a simple build to convolve an image, which store in Image directory.
